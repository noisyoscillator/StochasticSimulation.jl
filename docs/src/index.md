# StochasticSimulation.jl

`StochasticSimulation.jl` is a port of `SSJ`, a Java library for stochastic simulation developed under the
supervision of [Pierre L'Ecuyer](http://www-labs.iro.umontreal.ca/~lecuyer/) of the [Simulation and Optimization Laboratory](http://simul.iro.umontreal.ca/) and [Department of Computer Science and Operations Research](http://en.diro.umontreal.ca) at Université de Montréal.

`StochasticSimulation.jl` provides a framework for:
* Random number and random variate generation.
* Stochastic process simulation.
* Discrete-event simulation.
* Computations with several types of probability distributions.
* Randomized quasi-Monte Carlo methods.
* Collecting and reporting statistics from simulations.
* Goodness-of-fit tests.
